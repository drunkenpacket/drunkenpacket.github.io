Probably you know Evernote as one of the High Tech unicorns. I used to work for them. Though I left the work a while ago, I still use Evernote everyday. I have been evaluating alternatives. So far I am not finding better one for me.

Evernote service seems to be standing still for sevearl years. They used to push out new ideas and features all the time. Sometime I even felt we were doing too much. Then, they have stopped moving. It's there as it was.

Ironically a part of me feels that it's a good thing, since everything works as it used to work. No need to spend my time to learn new things. It's stable so that I can focus on my tasks. On the other hand, I have to be a bit concerned with their future. As we all know, there is always a competition in the market. They have to keep up with it to survive. If they fail to do so, the market will kill them quickly. And I will be forced to move. That is not cool.

Half a year ago Evernote have appointed a new CEO. I guess their board has recognized need for a change. Hopefully the new leadership can move the business to a right direction. If I were sitting in his chair, I would ask Phil Libin a help. He know Evernote inside and out, and he is an excellent product mastermind.
