Some opinions that have recently percolated into the packet's
awareness. Preserved here for our later amusement at how foolish I
could be.

* Rust is *hard*:
	* builds are slow
	* cross-compilation is hard (especially for `-sys` packages.)
	* Good luck getting a Rust/C++ binary to cross-compile.
	* hard to learn
* The Rust evangelization has found stony ground in the packet. I am almost always fine with sacrificing
a small amount of performance to excuse me from anticipating the complexities of object lifetimes. Please
some of you (who will certainly never read this) (but I know who I'm thinking of)
stop claiming that Go servers are crippled by the costs of automatic garbage collection while using all of
those webapps.
* [Tailscale Â· Best VPN Service for Secure Networks](https://tailscale.com/) is like magic. No really. It is.
I didn't believe how easy it was to get it working until I ran it and was delighted.
* [u-root/cpu: cpu command in Go, inspired by the Plan 9 cpu command](https://github.com/u-root/cpu) is
also magic once one understands the incantations. The packet should write more about the way of `cpu`. Or
maybe just more about anything.
